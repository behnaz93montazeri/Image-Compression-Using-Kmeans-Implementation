# Image-Compression-Using-Kmeans-Implementation

## Description

This project implements image compression using the K-means clustering algorithm. It reduces the number of colors in an image, allowing you to compress it while maintaining visual quality. The project includes a custom implementation of K-means, and it demonstrates the compression process using both artificial datasets from the scikit-learn library and real images.

## Usage

- Code and comments explaining the workflow is available in Jupyter Notebook (Image Compression using KMeans implementation-Project.ipynb) 
- make sure that you put the image "image_color.jpg" in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook is.
- Feel free to explore the code, data, and results within each project directory.

## Depencencies 
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Conclusion

This project aims to compress the image into fewer colors (in this project 16) using KMeans implementation. For sure, we can directly use the KMeans algorithm to do the same thing. Howver, I wanted to implement the algorithm from scratch for better underestanding.
